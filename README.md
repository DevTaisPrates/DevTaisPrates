- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevTaisPrates
- 👀 I'm interested in learning programming and developing my skills in the technology area.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning HTML and CSS to take my first steps in web development.
- 💞️ I seek to collaborate with other women to be part of the growing, but still small, female representation in technology. I want to contribute to strengthening the presence of women in this sector and inspiring more women to pursue this career.

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact:Something curious about me is that, despite having chosen the technology field, I have a great interest in art and design. I hope this passion gives me a unique perspective on interface development and helps me create impactful visual experiences.
